<h2>Block</h2>
<p>Block does not allow other boxes to sit right next to them, and it will use the whole space available
    horizontally.</p>
<div class="block">
    <div>Inner Div 1</div>
    <div>Inner Div 2</div>
</div>



<p> If the box with this display property does not fit in the space available,
    <span>it will try to fit some of its content</span>, and whatever does not fit goes to a new line. To do this,
    shrink your browser and see it break, and then toggle between block and inline-block to see the difference.</p>
